# angular-routing-template
### This template sets up a default Angular App with Routing. 

All routes are listed in the ./src/app/app-routing.module.ts file
Note that the root route gets redirected to the home route (you can change this as it is not required). 

Components are placed into the "Components" directory and the full pages are placed into the "Pages" directory inside the ./src/app directory
Note that there aren't currently any components in the "Components" directory as just dummy pages are rendered.
